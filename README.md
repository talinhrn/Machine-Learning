# Machine-Learning-
This repository contains a collection of machine learning assignments and mini-projects I completed as part of my Introduction to Machine Learning course. Each script explores a core concept or algorithm in ML, implemented using Python and standard libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. These projects were designed to build hands-on understanding of fundamental machine learning algorithms through implementation, experimentation, and evaluation. Each file is self-contained with code, comments, and in some cases, example plots or outputs.
